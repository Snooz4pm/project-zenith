You can't track 10,000 stocks manually. The brain can only handle ~7 variables.

## The Solution
The Zenith Score compresses hundreds of data points into one normalized value (0-100).

## Normalization Philosophy
A Score of 80 on Bitcoin means the same relative strength as 80 on a dividend stock.

### Pillar 1: Momentum (40%)
Rate of change, RSI, Stochastic. Assets that are accelerating.

### Pillar 2: Trend Architecture (30%)
Moving average alignment, ADX. Institutional conviction.

### Pillar 3: Volatility Structure (20%)
Bollinger width, ATR. Rewards orderly moves, punishes chaos.

### Pillar 4: Volume & Liquidity (10%)
OBV, RVOL, Chaikin. Volume is fuel.

> 📊 In crashes, the algorithm shifts more weight to Volatility to protect you.`

1. **Scan:** Score moving 40 → 70 in 24 hours
2. **Filter:** Price below major resistance
3. **Trigger:** Score hits 75 AND price breaks resistance
4. **Confirmation:** RVOL > 1.5

## Why It Works
By the time Score = 75, the engine is hot and context is proven. You enter at statistical confluence.

> 🛠️ A stock up 5% with Score = 25 is a dead cat bounce. Stay away.`

## Bearish Divergence
- Price: Higher High
- Score: Lower High
- Action: Take profit or short

## Bullish Divergence
- Price: Lower Low
- Score: Higher Low
- Action: Look for V-shaped recovery

> 🛠️ Score divergence accounts for 4 dimensions vs traditional 1-dimensional divergence.`
